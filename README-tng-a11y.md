# [Complianz â€“ GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/complianz-gdpr/) fork to fix accessibility problems

This branch `tng-a11y` is a Tanaguru fork to fix accessibility problems without submitting it for the moment because we're not ready.

In order to block updates in WordPress, the plugin has been temporarily renamed in the `complianz-gdpr.php` file.

Each fix is preceded by a comment `#start-tng-a11y` and followed by a comment `#end-tng-a11y` so you can find them easily.
