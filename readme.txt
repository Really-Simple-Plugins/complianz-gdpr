== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Knowledgebase =
Complianz maintains a continuously growing knowledgebase about GDPR, including subregions e.g. DSGVO and CNIL, CCPA, PIPEDA, COPPA, POPIA & other specific laws on [complianz.io](https://complianz.io)

= Is my website GDPR, COPPA, CCPA, DSGVO, TTDSG, AVG, CNIL, UK-GDPR, PECR, CASL, LGPD, POPIA and/or PIPEDA compliant with this plugin? =
We cannot guarantee compliance for your website. A correct configuration of this plugin by a website administrator is always required. 
= When do I need a Cookie Notice? =
Complianz | GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent will determine this automatically based on the laws of the region or regions, where most of your visitors come from. 
Regarding CCPA/CPRA, you always have to show which cookies you are using but there's no obligation in asking consent.
= Do I always need a consent checkbox on contact forms? =
Not always. The Complianz Privacy Suite Premium plugin can determine if you need this, based on your answers in the wizard. It mainly depends on the type of information and the reason why your visitor use the contact form.
= What is the GDPR? =
The GDPR is a regulation within the EU law on privacy and data protection for any citizen within the EU and European Economic Area. It aims primarily on giving control to individuals over their personal data. The GDPR also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU.
= What is the CCPA? =
The CCPA (Californian Privacy Act) is a law set up by the Californian government. The law is adjudged to be one of the toughest and farthest-reaching consumer privacy laws in the US. It is mostly focused on giving insights on what personal data business gather and how to protect and control these personal data.
= What is COPPA? =
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a law designed to protect the online privacy of children under 13. It was set up in the 1990's and states that website owners have to meet certain requirements regarding visitors with the age under 13.
= What are PECR & UK-GDPR? =
PECR (UK) covers the use of cookies and similar technologies for storing information and accessing information stored, on a user’s equipment such as a computer or mobile device.
= What are the Privacy Act 1988 & Australian Privacy Principles =
To comply with the Australian privacy laws a website operator should present a cookie policy and/or a privacy notice before or, if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable after, your website collects personal information about an individual.
= What are PIPEDA & CASL? =
Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) require a website operator to obtain consent, either implied or express consent with a dedicated cookie statement.
= What POPIA (POPI Act)? =
POPIA is the acronym for the South African PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACT. Similar to the GDPR, the UK-GDPR, and the Brasilian LGPD, it promotes the protection of personal information processed by public and private bodies, regulates the cross-border flow of personal information, and outlines the rights of data subjects.
= What are “Marco Civil” and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD)? =
The Brazilian General Data Protection Law is similar to the GDPR, the UK-GDPR it promotes the protection of personal information processed by public and private bodies, regulates the cross-border flow of personal information, and outlines the rights of data subjects. The Marco Civil is the Brazilian name of the Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet a counterpart to European's "ePrivacy", although not similar.
= Can I create a Cookie Wall with this plugin? =
With some custom CSS this is possible, but we do not consider a cookie wall to be GDPR compliant, so it's not actively supported. We do, however, have the option to create a Soft Cookie Wall. Which blocks interaction with the website, but dismissing remains a possibility.
