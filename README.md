## The Privacy Suite for WordPress

At Complianz we are working towards a full-featured privacy suite for all WordPress users to comply with the privacy guideliness for their targeted regions. And we try to make it as easy as possible, while respecting the different guidelines and variability. As privacy is not an easy subject we highly appreciate any feedback, pull requests and issues to further simplify this subject and improve our product, and therefore privacy-friendly websites world-wide and happy users.
